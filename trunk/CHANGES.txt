-------------------
-Added 'TwoNuclei.pul' demo file
-Cleaning of the 'Simple.pul' demo file.
-FIXED: Bug with the parameter Aliasing that was not properly initialised to False 
-FIXED: when filename contains \t or \n : e.g., "Pulsar\trunk\Workspace" is interpreted as "Pulsar {TAB} runk\Workspace").

-------------------
Initial version for realise candidate 0.1.RC1

-Use MatplotLib and Scipy (Can be compiled using PyInstaller with some hacks - See the Built_pyPulsar_EXE.cmd)

-To make this f2py working with LF95 5.6 on window, I had to modified the libc to libcmodified.lib (removing some conflicting objects using LM (library manager).
